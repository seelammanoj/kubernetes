TODO: check on high availability for k3s
- brush up on  all the k3s topics once more
- check on the nodes like master node and agent node
- check on the high availability for k3s
- check on the loadbalancer and quba lite
- Chapters Agent Tunnel, etcd management and Agent and client side loadbalancing 

Notes: on k3s high availability
- high availability is all about k3s cluster can tolerate failure and remain up and running and service traffic to the users
- Application should also be built and confugured for HA


steps to create HA k3s
- create three k3s server nodes(control plane) atleast
- create one k3s agent (worker node) atleast
- Check k3-agent-loadbalancer.json for running server nodes

to setting up high availability for k3s with the three control plane and one agent node
1st machine:
- mkdir -p /etc/rancher/k3s
- nano /etc/rancher/k3s/config.yaml (add the below data in this file)
	control-init: true
- install the k3s control plane in one machine
- curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
- kubectl get nodes 
- control plane node should be created and added to the cluster
- run the k3s-server with the control-init in the first machine 
- then add the other nodes to the cluster with the token generated from the first machine
- cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token

2nd machine:
- mkdir /etc/rancher/k3s
- nano /etc/rancher/k3s/config.yaml (append the below content in this file )
	token: "<get the token id from the first k3s-server node>"
	server: "https://<IP of the k3server1 node:6443>"
- rm -rf /var/lib/rancher/k3s  
- curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io/ sh -

3rd machine:
- same applies as 2nd machine
4th machine:
- Install the worker node (k3s-agent)
- add the token value as per the above
- install the k3s-agent using the below command
- curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -s agent
- check the file in /var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/k3s-agent-loadbalancer.json
- we should be able to see the all the server nodes IPs in the this loadbalancer
